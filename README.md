# boids

Boids, originally written by Craig Reynolds in 1986, is an artificial life program which simulates
flocking birds (but in this case just in 2D). It is an example of emergent behaviour; that is, the
complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents adhering to a set of simple
rules, (i) separation: steering to avoid crowding local flockmates, (ii) alignment: steer towards
the average heading of local flockmates, and (iii) cohesion: steer to move toward the average
position (center of mass) of local flockmates.
